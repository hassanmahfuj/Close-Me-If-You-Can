# Close Me If You Can
The Java Swing project you have created is a window application that displays an interesting message. However, if the user attempts to close the window by moving the mouse cursor towards the close button, the window dynamically moves to another position on the screen, preventing the user from closing it. This behavior adds an element of interactivity and playful challenge to the application.
